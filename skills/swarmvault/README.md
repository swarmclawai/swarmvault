# SwarmVault Skill

Use the SwarmVault skill when you want a local-first knowledge vault that compiles books, articles, notes, transcripts, chat exports, emails, calendars, datasets, spreadsheets, slide decks, screenshots, URLs, code, and research captures into durable markdown pages, a searchable graph, dashboards, context packs, a task memory ledger, and reviewable outputs on disk.

SwarmVault is built on the [LLM Wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) pattern: keep a durable wiki between you and raw sources using a three-layer architecture (raw sources, wiki, schema). The LLM does the bookkeeping — cross-referencing, consistency, updating — while you curate sources and think about what they mean. SwarmVault turns that pattern into a local toolchain with graph navigation, search, review flows, automation, and optional provider-backed synthesis.

## Install

Install the skill from ClawHub:

```bash
clawhub install swarmvault
```

Install the CLI it depends on:

```bash
npm install -g @swarmvaultai/cli
swarmvault --version
swarmvault demo --no-serve
swarmvault source add https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd
swarmvault ingest ./meeting.srt --guide
swarmvault ingest ./customer-call.mp3
swarmvault ingest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
swarmvault ingest --video https://example.com/product-demo.mp4
swarmvault source session transcript-or-session-id
```

Requirements:

- Node `>=24`
- A working `swarmvault` or `vault` binary on `PATH`

Update paths:

```bash
clawhub update swarmvault
npm install -g @swarmvaultai/cli@latest
```

## When To Use This Skill

- You want knowledge work to stay on disk instead of disappearing into chat history.
- The repo already contains `swarmvault.config.json` or `swarmvault.schema.md`.
- You want markdown wiki pages, graph artifacts, local search, approvals, candidates, and MCP exposure from the same workspace.
- You want a save-first compile/query/review loop for source collections, codebases, or research material.
- You want one workflow for mixed non-code material such as EPUBs, CSV/TSV files, XLSX workbooks, PPTX decks, transcripts, Slack exports, mailbox files, and calendar exports.

swarmvault mcp
```

For the fastest scratch walkthrough of a local repo, public GitHub repo, or docs tree, run `swarmvault scan ./path --no-serve`, `swarmvault scan ./path --no-viz`, or `swarmvault clone https://github.com/owner/repo --branch main --no-viz`. It initializes the current directory as a vault, ingests that input, compiles immediately, leaves the graph viewer closed when you only need the generated artifacts, and writes `wiki/graph/share-card.md`, `wiki/graph/share-card.svg`, and `wiki/graph/share-kit/`. Use `scan --mcp` or `clone --mcp` when the next step should be an MCP stdio server.

If you want the same zero-config walkthrough without supplying your own inputs first, run `swarmvault demo --no-serve`. It creates a temporary demo vault with bundled sources and compiles it immediately.

For very large graphs, `swarmvault graph serve` and `swarmvault graph export --html` automatically start in overview mode. Add `--full` when you explicitly want the full canvas rendered. `swarmvault graph share --post` prints a compact copyable summary, `swarmvault graph share --svg [path]` writes a 1200x630 visual card, `swarmvault graph share --bundle [dir]` writes a portable share kit for posting, linking, or screenshotting, `swarmvault graph status [path]` and `swarmvault check-update [path]` check graph/report freshness without writing watch artifacts, `swarmvault graph stats` prints lightweight graph counts and relation mix, `swarmvault graph validate [graph] --strict` checks duplicate ids, dangling references, confidence bounds, and conflicted-edge evidence before export/merge/push workflows, `swarmvault graph update [path]` and `swarmvault update [path]` block unexpected node/edge drops unless `--force` is explicit, `swarmvault watch [path] --once` targets one repo root without persisting watch config, `swarmvault graph query` accepts relation/context/evidence/node/language filters for focused traversal, `swarmvault graph tree [--output <html>]` / `swarmvault tree [--output <html>]` writes an interactive source/module/symbol tree with a node inspector, `swarmvault graph merge <graph...> --out <path>` / `swarmvault merge-graphs <graph...> --out <path>` combines SwarmVault or node-link graph JSON, `swarmvault graph cluster [--resolution <n>]` and `swarmvault cluster-only [vault]` recompute communities and graph report artifacts from the existing graph without re-ingest, and `graph export` also supports `--html-standalone`, `--json`, `--obsidian`, `--canvas`, and `--neo4j` when you need richer sharing, Obsidian-native artifacts, or a Neo4j-ready Cypher import. `swarmvault diff` compares the current graph against the last committed graph so you can inspect graph-level changes after a compile.

`swarmvault context build "<goal>" --target <path-or-node> --budget <tokens>` creates an agent-ready evidence pack from the compiled vault. It saves JSON under `state/context-packs/`, writes a markdown companion under `wiki/context/`, reports omitted items when the token budget is too small, and can print `markdown`, `json`, or `llms` output for kickoff prompts and handoffs.

`swarmvault task start "<goal>" --target <path-or-node>` creates a durable task ledger and automatically links an initial context pack. Use `swarmvault task update <id> --note|--decision|--changed-path|--context-pack`, `swarmvault task finish <id> --outcome <text>`, and `swarmvault task resume <id> --format markdown|json|llms` to preserve decisions, evidence, touched files, outcomes, and follow-ups for the next agent. The older `memory` commands remain compatibility aliases.

`swarmvault doctor` is the quickest whole-vault health check before an agent handoff or viewer session. It reports graph, retrieval, review queue, watch status, migration, managed-source, and task state; `--repair` rebuilds safe derived retrieval artifacts. The same checks are available in the graph viewer workbench and through MCP as `doctor_vault`; the workbench also shows prioritized next actions, check details, copyable suggested commands, explicit capture modes, title/tag capture fields, editable context/task token budgets, and action receipts.

The default `heuristic` provider is a valid local/offline starting point. Add a model provider in `swarmvault.config.json` when you want richer synthesis quality or optional capabilities such as embeddings, vision, or image generation. The recommended fully-local setup is `ollama pull gemma4` wired up as the `compileProvider` and `queryProvider` (see the root README for the exact config block). Any supported provider works - OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter, Groq, Together, xAI, Cerebras, openai-compatible, or custom. Code files are always parsed locally via tree-sitter; only non-code text or image sources go to configured model providers.

`swarmvault init --profile` accepts `default`, `personal-research`, or a comma-separated preset list such as `reader,timeline`. For a custom vault style, edit the `profile` block in `swarmvault.config.json` directly; `swarmvault.schema.md` stays the human-written intent layer. The `personal-research` preset also enables `profile.guidedIngestDefault` and `profile.deepLintDefault`, so guided ingest/source and lint flows are on by default until you opt out with `--no-guide` or `--no-deep`.

For local semantic graph query without API keys, point `tasks.embeddingProvider` at an embedding-capable local backend such as Ollama, not `heuristic`.

With an embedding-capable provider available, SwarmVault can also merge semantic page matches into local search by default. `tasks.embeddingProvider` is the explicit way to choose that backend, but SwarmVault can also fall back to a `queryProvider` with embeddings support. Set `retrieval.rerank: true` when you want the configured `queryProvider` to rerank the merged top hits before answering.

Audio and video ingest use `tasks.audioProvider` when you configure a provider with `audio` capability. The fully-local option is `swarmvault provider setup --local-whisper --apply`, which installs a `local-whisper` provider, downloads a whisper.cpp ggml model into `~/.swarmvault/models/`, and assigns `tasks.audioProvider` so voice memos, meetings, interviews, and video audio transcribe with no API keys and no network calls. Local video needs `ffmpeg`; public video URL ingest with `--video` needs `yt-dlp`. YouTube transcript ingest works without a model provider. If you want to pin graph clustering instead of using the adaptive default and its oversized/low-cohesion community split pass, set `graph.communityResolution` in `swarmvault.config.json` or run `swarmvault graph cluster --resolution <n>` for one recompute.

Set `SWARMVAULT_OUT=<dir>` when generated `raw/`, `wiki/`, `state/`, `agent/`, and `inbox/` artifacts should be isolated from the source tree. Config and schema files remain in the project root, which keeps shared source worktrees clean while still giving agents the same vault contract.

`swarmvault lint --deep --web` augments deep-lint findings with external evidence from a configured `webSearch` adapter. Web search is currently scoped to deep lint; compile, query, and explore stay on local vault state plus your configured LLM providers.

When the vault lives inside a git repo, `ingest`, `compile`, and `query` also accept `--commit` so generated `wiki/` and `state/` changes can be committed immediately. `compile --max-tokens <n>` trims lower-priority pages when you need bounded wiki output for a tighter context window.

Source-scoped artifacts are intentionally split by role:

| Artifact | Created by | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Source brief | `source add`, `ingest` (always) | Auto summary written to `wiki/outputs/source-briefs/` |
| Source review | `source review`, `source add --guide`, `ingest --review`, `ingest --guide` | Lighter staged assessment in `wiki/outputs/source-reviews/` |
| Source guide | `source guide`, `source add --guide`, `ingest --guide` | Guided walkthrough with approval-bundled updates in `wiki/outputs/source-guides/` |
| Source session | `source session`, `source add --guide`, `ingest --guide` | Resumable workflow state in `wiki/outputs/source-sessions/` and `state/source-sessions/` |

Supported non-code ingest includes `.pdf`, the full Word family (`.docx`, `.docm`, `.dotx`, `.dotm`), `.rtf`, `.odt`, `.odp`, `.ods`, `.epub`, `.csv`, `.tsv`, the full Excel family (`.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xlsb`, `.xls`, `.xltx`, `.xltm`), the full PowerPoint family (`.pptx`, `.pptm`, `.potx`, `.potm`), `.ipynb` (Jupyter notebooks), `.bib` (BibTeX), `.org` (Org-mode), `.adoc`/`.asciidoc`, `.srt`, `.vtt`, Slack exports, `.eml`, `.mbox`, `.ics`, audio files (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, `.aac`, `.ogg`, `.webm`, and other `audio/*` inputs) through `tasks.audioProvider`, video files (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.m4v`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, and other `video/*` inputs) through `ffmpeg` plus `tasks.audioProvider`, public video URLs with `--video` through `yt-dlp` plus `tasks.audioProvider`, direct YouTube transcript URLs, images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.bmp`, `.tif`, `.tiff`, `.svg`, `.ico`, `.heic`, `.heif`, `.avif`, `.jxl`), markdown/MDX/text notes, structured config/data (`.json`, `.jsonc`, `.json5`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.xml`, `.ini`, `.conf`, `.cfg`, `.env`, `.properties`) with schema hints, common developer manifests (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, and similar) via content-sniffed text ingest so they are never silently dropped, browser clips, and research URLs captured through `swarmvault add`.

Supported code ingest covers `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`, `.tsx`, `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`, `.py`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.java`, `.kt`, `.kts`, `.scala`, `.sc`, `.dart`, `.lua`, `.zig`, `.cs`, `.c`, `.cc`, `.cpp`, `.cxx`, `.h`, `.hh`, `.hpp`, `.hxx`, `.php`, `.rb`, `.ps1`, `.psm1`, `.psd1`, `.ex`, `.exs`, `.ml`, `.mli`, `.m`, `.mm`, `.res`, `.resi`, `.sol`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, `.jl`, `.v`, `.vh`, `.sv`, `.svh`, `.r`, `.R`, `.css`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.sql`, plus extensionless executable scripts with `#!/usr/bin/env node|python|ruby|bash|zsh` shebangs. Parser-backed local analysis extracts symbols, imports, local module references, dynamic JS/TS imports, Julia modules/types/functions, and Verilog/SystemVerilog modules/interfaces/packages/instantiations; SQL also emits table/view symbols plus read/write/join/reference graph edges. R emits an explicit parser diagnostic until a safe packaged grammar exists.

## Core Workflow

1. Initialize the vault with `swarmvault init`.
2. Treat `swarmvault.schema.md` as the vault contract before serious compile or query work.
3. Use `swarmvault source add` when the input is a recurring local file, local directory, public GitHub repo root, or docs hub that should stay registered. Add `--branch`, `--ref`, or `--checkout-dir` for pinned public GitHub repo sources.
4. Add one-off material with `swarmvault ingest`, `swarmvault add`, or `swarmvault inbox import`.
5. Use `swarmvault ingest --guide`, `swarmvault source add --guide`, `swarmvault source reload --guide`, `swarmvault source guide <id>`, or `swarmvault source session <id>` when you want the stronger guided-session workflow. Set `profile.guidedIngestDefault: true` when guided mode should be the default for ingest/source commands, and use `--no-guide` to force the lighter path for a specific run. Profiles using `guidedSessionMode: "canonical_review"` stage approval-queued canonical page edits; `insights_only` profiles keep exploratory synthesis under `wiki/insights/`.
6. Compile with `swarmvault compile`, use `compile --max-tokens <n>` when the generated wiki must fit a bounded context window, or use `compile --approve` when the change should land in the approval queue first.
7. Inspect `wiki/`, `wiki/dashboards/`, and `state/` artifacts before broad re-search. When the vault lives inside git, `ingest|compile|query --commit` can commit those artifacts immediately after the run.
8. Use `swarmvault query`, `swarmvault context build`, `swarmvault task`, `swarmvault memory`, `swarmvault explore`, `swarmvault review`, `swarmvault candidate`, and `swarmvault lint` to keep the vault current and reviewable. Set `profile.deepLintDefault: true` when `lint` should run the advisory deep pass by default, and use `--no-deep` to force a structural-only run.
9. Use `swarmvault doctor [--repair]` when the vault needs one health summary before deeper troubleshooting or handoff.
10. Use `swarmvault graph share --post` for a quick copyable summary, `swarmvault graph share --svg [path]` for a visual share card, `swarmvault graph share --bundle [dir]` for a portable share kit, `swarmvault graph blast` for reverse-import impact checks, `swarmvault graph status [path]` or `swarmvault check-update [path]` for read-only graph freshness checks, `swarmvault graph stats` for lightweight counts and relation mix, `swarmvault graph validate [graph] --strict` before export/merge/push workflows, `swarmvault graph update [path] --force` or `swarmvault update [path] --force` only when a large graph shrink is expected, `swarmvault graph query "<seed>" --context calls --evidence extracted` for focused relation-aware traversal, `swarmvault graph tree` for an interactive source/module/symbol tree, `swarmvault graph merge <graph...> --out <path>` for combining SwarmVault or node-link JSON, `swarmvault graph cluster` or `swarmvault cluster-only` for graph community/report refresh without re-ingest, `swarmvault graph serve` for the live workspace, detailed health workbench, prioritized next actions, explicit capture modes, title/tag capture fields, budgeted agent handoffs, and bookmarklet clipper, `swarmvault graph export --report` for a self-contained HTML report, `swarmvault graph export --neo4j <path>` for a Neo4j-ready Cypher import, other `swarmvault graph export` formats, `swarmvault graph push neo4j`, or `swarmvault mcp` when the vault needs to be explored or shared elsewhere.

## What SwarmVault Writes

- `SWARMVAULT_OUT` can relocate generated artifact directories while keeping config and schema at the project root
- `raw/sources/` and `raw/assets/` for canonical input storage
- `wiki/` for compiled source, concept, entity, code, graph, and output pages
- `wiki/outputs/source-briefs/` for recurring-source onboarding briefs
- `wiki/outputs/source-sessions/` for resumable guided session anchors
- `wiki/outputs/source-reviews/` for staged source-scoped review artifacts
- `wiki/outputs/source-guides/` for guided source integration artifacts
- `wiki/dashboards/` for recent sources, reading log, timeline, source sessions, source guides, research map, contradictions, and open questions
- `wiki/graph/share-card.md`, `wiki/graph/share-card.svg`, and `wiki/graph/share-kit/` for post-ready text, visual graph summaries, HTML preview, and JSON metadata generated on compile
- `wiki/context/` for markdown context-pack companions
- `wiki/memory/` for task ledger index and markdown task pages
- `wiki/candidates/` for staged concept/entity pages
- `state/graph.json` for the compiled graph
- `state/context-packs/` for saved JSON context packs with citations, token-budget accounting, included items, and omitted items
- `state/memory/tasks/` for saved JSON task ledger records
- `state/retrieval/` for the local retrieval index and manifest
- `state/sources.json` plus `state/sources/<id>/` for managed-source registry state and working sync data
- `state/approvals/` for compile approval bundles
- `state/sessions/` and `state/jobs.ndjson` for saved run history

Generated guided artifacts and dashboards also carry Dataview-friendly fields such as `profile_presets`, `session_status`, `question_state`, `canonical_targets`, and `evidence_state` when you enable `profile.dataviewBlocks`.
